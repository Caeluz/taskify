# Features To be Added

## 1. Add save all features - [Settings Page](../src/app/projects/[id]/settings/page.tsx)

- When user edits a form, there would be an alert at the bottom that would say would you live to save the changes
- When user clicks on the save button, the form would be saved and the alert would disappear
- When user clicks on the cancel button, the form would be reset to the original values and the alert would disappear

- useState
- useEffect

What would be the needed functions:

- saveForm
- resetForm

## 2. Add an announcement page on Projects section - [Announcement Page](../src/app/projects/[id]/announcement/page.tsx)

- When user clicks on the announcement page, they would be able to see all the announcements that have been made

## 3. Add Notifications for users in side bar
